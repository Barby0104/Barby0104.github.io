##Welcome to MyPetBlogs

New to the world of blogging, I have decided to post all the things my mini aussie plays with, eats, and among other related pet items.
He is a very active little dog and enjoys a lot of treats, but there are a few he dislikes. I also have a red ear slider, who really only cares about live shrimp or anything shrimp related.

I will try my best to post whenever Tony the mini aussie gets something new and see what he thinks about his puppy products. As for Misty the turtle, I'll post about new things for her tank.

Have an awesome blossom day :)
