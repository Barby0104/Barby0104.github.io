##These dog treats taste really good!

Barb: Today I went to our local, family owned pet store, they have a vast selection of dog and cat food, toys, treats, etc.
These bags caught my eye because it says organic in big letters and they had a picture of either fruit/veggie on their bag. 
I went ahead and got blueberry and pumpkin Grandma Lucy's baked treats and went on to browse the store. As I head to the check out, 
the cashier mentions that not just doggies enjoy these treats, but people do too. He offered me to try one and I thought to my self, 
why not. These "dog treats" taste like legit cookies made for humans. The cashier mentioned that since they taste really good, there
has been customers that come and buy these treats for themselves! As soon as I arrived home, I opened the pumpkin bag and it smelled 
like a sublte pumpkin spiced latte. Tony on the other hand was really excited to try and gobbled one of each flavor. The blueberry one
does have a sweet scent as I opened it and it was very pleasant. 

Pros:
Great tasting treat for human and dog
Variety of flavors; cranberry, banana & sweet potato, appple, blueberry, pumpkin, and peach
Reasonable pricing, but I'm sure you can get it even more affordable on Amazon
Natural and organic
Great quality and taste

Cons:
Humans could end up eating the whole bag of treats lol

As for Tony this is his review

Tony: THEY TASTED GREAT MORE PLEASE
